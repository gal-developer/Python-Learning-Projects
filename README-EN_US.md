### Phase 1: Python Fundamentals
**Goal:** Master programming logic and core syntax.
* [cite_start]**Environment:** Professional setup (PyCharm), data types, and snake_case standards[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Logic:** Conditionals (if/else), logical operators, and loops (for/while)[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Structures:** Advanced manipulation of Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]**Modularization:** Creating reusable functions, parameters, and return values[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Data Handling:** Persistence in .txt/.csv files and exception handling (try/except)[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**Project:** Sales Management CLI System with data persistence[cite: 13].

### Phase 2: Git & Productivity
**Goal:** Version control and portfolio management.
* [cite_start]**Versioning:** Local workflow with git init, add, commit, and status[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**GitHub:** Remote synchronization, push/pull, and README management[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Isolation:** Virtual environments (venv) and dependency management (pip)[cite: 17].

### Phase 3: SQL & Databases
**Goal:** Master data extraction directly from the source.
* [cite_start]**Queries:** SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LIMIT, and ORDER BY[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]**Aggregation:** Mathematical functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT) and GROUP BY[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Relational:** Set theory applied to multiple types of JOINs[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]**Project:** KPI extraction from real relational databases (SQLite/PostgreSQL)[cite: 22].

### Phase 4: Data Analysis with Python
**Goal:** Transform raw data into actionable insights.
* [cite_start]**NumPy:** Numerical computing and multi-dimensional arrays[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Pandas:** DataFrame manipulation, cleaning missing data, and indexing[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Engineering:** Variable transformation and calculated indicators[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**Visualization:** Data storytelling with Matplotlib and Seaborn[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**Project:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Kaggle dataset[cite: 26].

### Phase 5: Statistics for Data
**Goal:** Provide scientific grounding for business analysis.
* [cite_start]**Descriptive:** Central tendency, dispersion, variance, and outliers[cite: 28].
* [cite_start]**Probability:** Distributions (Normal, Poisson) and causality analysis[cite: 29].
* [cite_start]**Inference:** Hypothesis Testing, P-Value, and A/B Testing[cite: 30].
* [cite_start]**Advanced EDA:** Technical reports with rigorous statistical visualization[cite: 31].
* [cite_start]**Project:** Statistical validation of business hypotheses[cite: 32].
